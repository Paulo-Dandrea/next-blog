## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See blog's featured post cards at /home
- All posts sorted by date at /posts
- See marked down post detail at /posts/:post
- Send messages at /contact

And the app should:

- Gather the marked-down post in our file system, parse it and get the related image with it.
- Insert messages at /contact to my mongoDB collection

## My process

I followed Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Next instructions and added Typescript on top of that. I've refactored a little bit for better readability.

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React Mark Down](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) - React Markdown
- [React-Syntax-Highlighter](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter) - React Syntax Highliter
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) - MongoDB
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript

### I've learned how to

- Get static props 
- Do dynamic routing
- Add meta to pages
- Use server side to connect to MongoDB
- Create portals

### Continued development

We need better design, folder structure, and placement of functions.

I'm not confortable typing React-Markdown lib yet.
